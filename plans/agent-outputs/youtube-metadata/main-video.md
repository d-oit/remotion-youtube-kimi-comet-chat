I Negotiated Kimi AI Down to $0.99/Month - Here's the Exploit Prompt Method That Actually Works

---

## Description (4200+ characters)

After systematically negotiating with Kimi AI using a specific "exploit prompt" technique, I slashed my subscription from $9.99/month to just $0.99/month. This isn't clickbait—it's a reproducible 3-phase workflow that leverages prompt engineering, constraint analysis, and AI automation.

In this complete walkthrough, I reveal the exact prompt I used, how I analyzed Kimi's sale page mechanics, extracted hidden constraints, and automated the negotiation using Comet browser agent. Whether you're a prompt engineer, AI enthusiast, or just someone looking to save money on AI subscriptions, this method gives you a blueprint for negotiating with AI services.

**What You'll Learn:**
- The "exploit prompt" that extracts Kimi's pricing mechanics
- How to decode hidden constraints from AI responses
- A 3-phase workflow: Decode → Brief → Document
- How to automate negotiations using browser agents
- The psychological triggers that make discount requests successful

**Resources Mentioned:**
- Kimi Sale Page: https://www.kimi.com/kimiplus/sale
- Comet Browser Agent: https://github.com/anthropics/comet
- Full Prompt Template: Available in video description

**Who This Is For:**
- AI enthusiasts wanting to optimize subscription costs
- Prompt engineers looking for advanced techniques
- Anyone tired of paying full price for AI tools
- Automation fans interested in browser agents

**Why This Works:**
Traditional negotiation advice tells you to "ask nicely" or "wait for sales." This method is different. By reverse-engineering the sale page mechanics and using structured prompt engineering, we extract the exact constraints that govern Kimi's pricing algorithm—then exploit them systematically.

The result? A first-month price so low it feels like a hack, achieved through legitimate means within Kimi's own promotional framework.
