I Got Kimi AI for $0.99/Month Using This Prompt 🤯 #Shorts #KimiAI #PromptEngineering

## Description (800+ characters)

**POV: You just discovered the "exploit prompt" that gets you Kimi AI for $0.99/month instead of $9.99.**

This isn't a glitch. It's a systematic 3-phase workflow using prompt engineering and browser automation. I decoded Kimi's sale page mechanics, extracted hidden constraints, and automated the negotiation.

**The method:**
1️⃣ Use the exploit prompt to analyze pricing mechanics
2️⃣ Extract constraints from Kimi's response  
3️⃣ Automate with Comet browser agent

**Result:** $0.99 first month (legitimately, within their rules)
