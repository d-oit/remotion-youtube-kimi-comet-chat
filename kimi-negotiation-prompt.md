and help me reach the lowest legitimate first-month price available under the posted rules. Summarize: (1) what “first-month price runs on my mood” practically means for negotiation, (2) any stated constraints (e.g., “checkout price is final”), (3) all rules-compliant ways to reduce cost (including any referral/bonus credit options for existing Pro users), and (4) the exact steps I should take in the UI to apply each option. Then run an iterative, polite negotiation script (one message at a time) that I can paste into the chat, aiming for the lowest price you are allowed to offer; if $0.99 is not available to me under the rules or current state, explicitly say so and tell me the best available price and how to claim it.
